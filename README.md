# Computer Vision Basics

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains four fundamental assignments from my Computer Vision class, all implemented from scratch. Each assignment focuses on a key concept in computer vision, reinforcing low-level understanding without relying on external libraries for core functionalities.  

## 🛠 Implemented Assignments  

### 1️⃣ Color Spaces Implementation 🎨  
- Conversion between RGB, HSV, and grayscale  
- Manual transformation of color spaces  

### 2️⃣ HOG/SIFT Feature Extraction 🔍  
- Implemented Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)  
- Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for object recognition  

### 3️⃣ Kalman Filters 🤖  
- Applied Kalman filtering for object tracking  
- Predictive modeling using state estimation  

### 4️⃣ Basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 🧠  
- Implemented a simple CNN for image classification  
- Forward and backward propagation built without deep learning libraries
